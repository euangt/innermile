# InnerMile: 

See the 'finished' product at www.innermile.org - for UX purposes we strongly recommend searching and/or registering (so as to view all features) with an address in close proximity to Rosenthaler Platz, Berlin.

## About:

A Ruby on Rails project built to encourage community engagement while driving commerce at a local level. Designed on the premise of providing map-based search results within a mile radius from the user's home address. 

The origin of the project lies in the collapse on high-streets in the UK as individuals turn to online shopping, as well as broader concerns over the impact that large online retailers (looking at you, Jeff) and their global supply chains are having on both local business and, more widely, the environment. 

The app represents the MVP of our wider vision for InnerMile, and will be continually updated as new features are added, code refactored and processes streamlined. 

## Our Framework:

Built with Ruby on Rails:

  - Ruby and JS backend
  - HTML, SCSS and JS frontend
  - PostGreSQL DB alongside Redis
  - Deployed and managed through Heroku
